I love building user friendly mobile experiences. I build robust and scalable Android apps and continuously learning.
<br>
<br>
👨‍💻 I have a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development and I design, develop and deploy apps that meet high standards. Currently I am focused on learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
<br>
<br>
💻 I am proficient in Java and Kotlin and learning various libraries and tools for Android development. I love coding and solving problems and that drives me to learn and grow.
<br>
<br>
📚 I participate in competitive programming on platforms like LeetCode, CodeChef and Codeforces to improve my problem solving skills. When I am not coding you can find me exploring new tech, reading about latest tech or attending local meetups and hackathons.
